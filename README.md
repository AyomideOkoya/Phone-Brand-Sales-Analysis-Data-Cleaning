## Dataset Cleaning and Preparation Process

### Tools Used
- **Database Management System:** SQL (for data cleaning and transformation)
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau (for dashboard creation)
- **Data Format:** CSV file (raw dataset)

---

### 1. Understanding the Dataset
The raw dataset was in CSV format and contained the following key fields:
- **Brand Name:** Manufacturer of the phone.
- **Model Name:** Phone model (e.g., iPhone 13 Pro Max).
- **Selling Price:** Final price after discounts.
- **Original Price:** Initial price before discounts.
- **Discount Percentage:** Percentage discount applied to the phone.
- **Ratings:** Customer ratings out of 5.
- **Features:** Product attributes like the presence of a camera, storage capacity, etc.
- and so on

### 2. Challenges in the Raw Data
The dataset had the following issues:
- **Missing Values:** Fields like ratings and discount percentages had null values.
- **Inconsistent Formatting:** Brand and model names had variations in spelling and capitalization.
- **Outliers:** Unrealistic values in price and ratings (e.g., negative discounts, ratings above 5).
- **Duplicate Records:** Duplicate entries for certain phone models.
- **Data Type Errors:** Numeric columns like `Selling Price` were stored as text.
